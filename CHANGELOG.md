## MecksUnit CHANGELOG

### Version 0.1.2 (January 15, 2019)

* Added `called` and `assert_called` to assert function calls within (asynchronous) tests

### Version 0.1.1 (January 14, 2019) [RETIRED]

* This version is retired as the assertion of function calls (extracted from Mock) are not supported in asynchronous tests (forgot about that)

### Version 0.1.0 (January 12, 2019)

* Initial release
